  Output: Welcome to the 14.310x Advanced R course! This short interactive course is designed
    to provide you with knowledge that you will find useful when working with R during this course
    (and beyond!). Note that while that none of the information presented here is necessary to
    complete the assignments for 14.310x, this course is highly recommended, particularly for those
    who plan to continue working with R following 14.310x. Are you ready to get started?

    Output: Great, let's get started! This course will utilize the interactive Swirl environment
      again, which means that you'll navigate the interface in RStudio the same way you did
      in the Intro to R course!

    Output: As a quick recap: hit the (Esc) key if you are within the module (as indicated by the
      (>) key) to navigate your way out. You may also type "bye()" to save your progress. Within the
      module, enter "info()" in the command prompt to get a list of navigation options. When the Swirl
      environment asks you "What should I call you?" be sure to enter the same name consistently to keep
      track of your progress. To call up the Swirl environment again later, install the library "library(swirl)"
      and enter the method "swirl()". Lastly, use the skip() command if you are stuck only as a last resort! You
      can't use the skip() command in the real world, so it's good practice to troubleshoot your errors first
      before giving up.

      Output: This course is organized into 17 modules (excluding this Welcome module).
        Each of these modules is about 15-20 min long, and will cover a specific set of topics.
        You can find the list of topics and commands within each module on the 14.310x edx page.

      Output: One last thing-- you will likely need to install some new helpful packages in order to
        run this course. The packages will help you later if you continue to use R and are mostly related
        to graphics. When prompted in the command line to install new packages, please say Yes, or you will
        be unable to complete this course! Have fun!
